## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### Continued development

I would really like to not use media query for developing mobile-size display. Instead I'm learning Bootstrap to implement the same.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Button Creator](https://cssbuttoncreator.com/) - This helped me create CSS for my button really quickly.
